# SQL-Project
The project name is "Sephora Merchandising Analysis". 
The objective is to analyze Ulta's data and provide actionable insights for Sephora's merchandising team to 
improve their product assortment and sales. The problem being solved is that Sephora wants to improve its product 
assortment and sales, and by analyzing Ulta's data, they can gain insights into what products and brands are popular
and identify opportunities to improve their assortment.

The project will be solved by collecting and analyzing Ulta's data and creating SQL queries to identify 
trends, popular brands, and products. The job posting is related to the project as it involves managing 
brand assortments for up to 400 stores, analyzing the business, and staying on top of trends, new products, and brands. 
By analyzing Ulta's data, Sephora's merchandising team can gain insights into which brands and products are popular, identify 
opportunities to improve their assortment, and stay on top of trends.

The data source is Ulta's Top Sellers Skincare page which can be reached using this URL: https://www.ulta.com/shop/skin-care/all?sort=best_sellers. 
I web scarped the URL to find information on the top-selling skin-care products at Ulta. The dataset contains 96 rows of products. 
The characteristics of the data include product names, brand names, prices, and customer ratings.

The data_collection.ipynb notebook collects and cleans the Ulta data, and the sql_analysis.ipynb notebook analyzes the data using SQL queries. 
The data_collection.ipynb notebook includes code for loading the data into a Pandas dataframe and cleaning the data, including handling missing values and formatting columns. 
The sql_analysis.ipynb notebook includes SQL queries that analyze the data and answer various business questions.

The GitHub repository contains both the data_collection.ipynb and sql_analysis.ipynb notebooks.

Future improvements to the project could include collecting more data from other retailers to gain a better understanding of industry trends and 
conducting more in-depth analyses to identify patterns and make recommendations for product assortment and pricing strategies. 
Additionally, the project could be expanded to include analyses of Sephora's own sales data to compare and contrast with Ulta's data.
